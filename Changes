0.92: 03 Feb 2012

- Cleanups and fixes for Debian packaging by Boris Peck.


0.91: 17 May 2011

- Support calling commands noninteractively (patch by Christian Kuelker)
- Support calling $term->run() multiple times (patch by Ryan Gies)
- Now clients can call process_a_cmd manually (patch by Martin Kluge)
- Undeprecate Term::ReadLine::Perl since it works better on Windows.


0.9: 20 Mar 2011

- Relicensed from the somewhat ambiguous Perl license to the MIT license.
- Add eof_exit_hooks, patch by Lester Hightower
- Remove complete_history callback. It was an odd, ShellUI-specific feature.
- Remove history expansion (!!, !$, ^o^n).  That implementation was too buggy.
- Fix bug: completion suggestion wasn't printed with Term::ReadLine::Gnu.
- Deprecate Term::ReadLine::Perl. Use Term::ReadLine::Gnu.


0.86: 26 Apr 2007

- Removed the use.t test.  Bugs in Term::ReadLine::X would cause this
  test to fail randomly and always seemed to evade my workarounds.
- Renamed 'syn' to 'alias'.  'syn' will continue to work indefinitely.
- If a completion routine returns a string, the string will now be printed.
  Before we would just error out ungracefully.
- Fixed http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=26692 reported by Erik Sherk


0.85: 7 June 2006

- Renamed 'meth' to 'method'.  'meth' will continue to work indefinitely
  so there's no need to change your code.
- Renamed the module to ShellUI.  A simple s/GDBUI/ShellUI/g should be all
  that's required to continue to use this module.


0.84: 27 Apr 2006

- Added two features suggested by Don Rodgers:
- backslash_continues_command to support command continuation.
- exclude_from_history to prevent a command from being stored in the history.


0.83:

- Re-enable ornaments by default.  (Term::GDBUI turned ornaments off because
  it was exposing Term::ReadLine::Gnu bugs that have since been fixed).


0.821: 27 Dec 2004

- Print the ReadLine lib being used in the synopsis script
- Turn off tainting in use.t.  Term::ReadKey (and therefore
  Term::ReadLine::Perl) can't handle it.


0.82:  23 Dec 2004

- You can now supply an anonymous sub as a prompt (see fileman-example).
- Fix from Erick Calder to fix completion when using Term::ReadLine::Perl.
- Try to fix "Cannot open /dev/tty" errors when running automated tests.
- Convert tabs in most files to spaces.
- A few doc fixups.


0.811: 02 Feb 2004

- 'make test' used to require FreezeThaw.  I didn't realize the barrage
  of testing errors that would cause.  Rewritten to be self-sufficient.


0.81: 31 Jan 2004

- somehow I left the pm_to_blib file in the tarball, breaking builds.  Removed.
- it turns out CPAN indexes the namespace in the examples directory too.  Arg.
  Changed all private Connection::BLAH modules to be RPC::Connection::BLAH.


0.8:  rev 40  30 Jan 2004

This release introduced one possible compatibility issue.
- fixed a few bugs where the default command ('') wasn't being called.
- made all method calling print an error if method can't be found
- doc subroutines now get the command name as an argument
- history quick substitution ^search^repl now works
- split the parser off into Text::Shellwords::Cursor
- now join_line puts space on both sides of token_chars chars
- fixed save hist bug: GDBUI was saving the first 500 cmds instead of the last.
- now repeats the last arg in a [] arg list forever (or until maxargs)
- fixed off-by-one in parser (only when using keep_quotes option)
- Added the force_to_string completion helper routine
- raised default maximum saved history from 64 to 500
- added default command and argument handlers (if the cmd couldn't be found)
- provide bang completion, but you must enable it in your command set
- added a default history command: history_call
* completion returns an arrayref so it can return undef to highlight an error
  in your completion routines: return [@result]; instead of return @result;
- we now support automatic bang history
- we now sort help summaries
- made file completion work with absolute pathnames
- reorg'd pod, putting most important stuff at top
- we now put a final newline on the command history file


0.61: 16 Dec 2003

- initial release
