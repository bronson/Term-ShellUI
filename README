Term::GDBUI README

16 Dec 2003


Term::GDBUI makes it easy (almost trivial) to implement a very comprehensive
Bash or GDB-like user interface.  It supports history, autocompletion,
quoting, escaping, pretty much everything you would expect of a decent
shell.

To use this class, you just need to declare your command set (see the
module's POD for how, or look at the examples).  You need to write almost
no code.

This module is similar to Sullivan Beck's Term::TUI module.  Unfortunately,
Term::TUI presents its own hierarchical-style interface while I needed
strict GDB compliance or DDD would be very unhappy.  If my module doesn't
do what you want, I suggest you give Term::TUI a look.  I even implemented
TUI's sample.pl file using GDBUI for comparison.  See the tui-sample file.


PREREQUISITES

None!  It runs just fine with Perl's default Term::ReadLine.  However,
it will be missing a number of features such as command history,
completion, etc.  Install Term::ReadLine::GNU or Term::ReadLine::Perl
to take advantage of these.
