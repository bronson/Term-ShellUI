Term::ShellUI makes it easy to implement a comprehensive Bash or
GDB-like command line user interface.  It supports history,
autocompletion, quoting, escaping, pretty much everything you would
expect of a decent shell.


PREREQUISITES

None!  It runs just fine with Perl's default Term::ReadLine.  However,
you will not be able to use some features such as command history,
completion, etc.  Install Term::ReadLine::GNU or Term::ReadLine::Perl
to take full advantage of Term::ShellUI's features.


INSTALLATION

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install


USAGE

Fire up examples/synopsis-big.  Hit 'help' to display the available
commands or 'help exists' to show detailed help for a command.  Notice
how everything can be tab-completed.  Experiment with passing the wrong
number of arguments to a command.  Scroll back through history using the
up arrow and use the history command.  Use !! to repeat the last command
or !$ to repeat just the last argument.

Run 'perldoc lib/Term/ShellUI.pm' to see the API documentation.
