Term::ShellUI makes it easy to implement a comprehensive Bash or
GDB-like command line user interface.  It supports history,
autocompletion, quoting, escaping, pretty much everything you would
expect of a decent shell.

CODE

Git: git clone git://github.com/bronson/Term-ShellUI.git
Svn: svn co http://svn.github.com/bronson/Term-ShellUI.git Term-ShellUI


PREREQUISITES

None!  It runs just fine with Perl's default Term::ReadLine.  However,
unless you install Term::ReadLine::GNU, basic functionality like
completion, line editing, and history will not work.

If you're on Windows then Term::ReadLine::Perl will be easier to install
and work almost as well.  The only limitation is that it can't print
hints for the user during completion (the completemsg call).


INSTALLATION

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install


USAGE

Run examples/synopsis-big.  Type 'help' to display the available commands
or 'help exists' to show detailed help for the exists command.  Notice how
everything can be tab-completed.  Try passing the wrong number of
arguments to a command.  Scroll back through history using the up arrow
or Control-R.  Also try using the history command.

Run 'perldoc lib/Term/ShellUI.pm' to see the API documentation.

Report bugs and submit patches via GitHub.


ALTERNATIVES

Term::CiscoCLI         http://ciscocli.sourceforge.net/
  A fork/rewrite to make the command line feel like a Cisco
  (Stanford) style CLI.  Also adds a bunch of useful features.

Term::TUI
  Presents a hierarchical command line interface.
