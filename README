Term::ShellUI README

16 Dec 2003


Term::ShellUI makes it easy (almost trivial) to implement a very comprehensive
Bash or GDB-like user interface.  It supports history, autocompletion,
quoting, escaping, pretty much everything you would expect of a decent
shell.

This module would seem similar to Sullivan Beck's Term::TUI module
except that Term::TUI uses a custom hierarchical-style interface
whereas ShellUI tries to emulate Bash and GDB as much as possible.


PREREQUISITES

None!  It runs just fine with Perl's default Term::ReadLine.  However,
you will not be able to use some features such as command history,
completion, etc.  Install Term::ReadLine::GNU or Term::ReadLine::Perl
to take full advantage of Term::ShellUI's features.
