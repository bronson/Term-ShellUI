Term::ShellUI makes it easy to implement a comprehensive Bash or
GDB-like command line user interface.  It supports history,
autocompletion, quoting, escaping, pretty much everything you would
expect of a decent shell.

PREREQUISITES

None!  It runs just fine with Perl's default Term::ReadLine.  However,
until you install Term::ReadLine::GNU, completion, editing, and history
will not be available.  If you're on Windows then Term::ReadLine::Perl
will probably be easier to install but it doesn't support completemsg().


INSTALLATION

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install


USAGE

Run examples/synopsis-big.  Hit 'help' to display the available commands
or 'help exists' to show detailed help for a command.  Notice how
everything can be tab-completed.  Try passing the wrong number of
arguments to a command.  Scroll back through history using the up arrow
or Control-R and use the history command.

Run 'perldoc lib/Term/ShellUI.pm' to see the API documentation.
